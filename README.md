# Taco-Cloud

Taco Cloud is a Spring Boot web application that allows users to design, order, and manage tacos.
Itâ€™s built following modern Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security best practices.

This project is inspired by Spring in Action and serves as a hands-on example for learning full-stack Java web development.
